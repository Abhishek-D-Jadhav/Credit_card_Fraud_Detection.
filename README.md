Credit card fraud is a widespread problem with serious effects. It's more than just an expensive issue that costs banks across the world billions of dollars every year. It's also a big hassle for everyday people, causing them to lose trust and feel less safe. This is why we need a strong and trustworthy system that can spot fraud quickly and correctly. In this project, I am applying machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions. This has the potential to significantly reduce the time taken to identify fraudulent activities, enabling quicker preventive actions and minimizing financial losses.
We have a dataset of credit card transactions from kaggle, each labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. Our objective is to train machine learning models that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions based on transaction details.
